Please give me a relatively unknown species of animals that most people will not have heard. It should sound interesting and ideally funny (even potentially dark or sexy using double entendres).
Examples are:
Nonsense Rat 
Sarcastic Fringehead 
Unexpected Cotton Rat 
Turbo Shrew 
Ultimate Shrew 
Perplexing Scrubwren
Giant thorny-headed worm of swine 
Disorderly-Bristled Stumpy Earthworm 
Sparklemuffin Hawaiian Happyface Spider 

Please answer only with the name and nothing else. Don't reuse the examples above. The species must actually exist and cannot be made up.
